<h2>Good Night</h2>
<p>It is a fun-filled movie.Everyone should live their life without finding small mistakes in it.
    When we are with our loved ones even their deficiency doesn't matters us. </p>
<h2>Gatta kushti</h2>
<p>It is a good movie.They should not generalize the activities.Both men and women can do the same activity.
    We should treat them equally</p>
